`More -> Camera`

Cameras can be used to capture still images, create time-lapses, and stream video. Cameras may also be used by Functions to trigger a camera image or video capture (as well as the ability to email the image/video with a notification).

Cameras can be accessed by the following libraries: picamera (Raspberry Pi Camera), fswebcam, opencv, urllib, and requests.

This enables images to be acquired from the Raspberry Pi camera, USB cameras and webcams, and IP cameras that are accessible by a URL. Furthermore, using the urllib and request libraries, any image URL can be used to acquire images.
